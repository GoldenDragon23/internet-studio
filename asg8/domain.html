      <p>
        I discussed my three potential domain names with my classmate. We talked about 
        how each one explains the idea of bringing car lovers together. My classmate liked how 
        <strong>CarCultureHub.com</strong> felt like a central place for enthusiasts to 
        share their passion, while <strong>RevNation.net</strong> had an energetic tone that captures the thrill of driving.
      </p>
      <p>
        The domain name I like best is <strong>DriveUnity.com</strong> because it represents the purpose 
        of my website is to unite car lovers under one platform where people can share builds, photos, and events.
