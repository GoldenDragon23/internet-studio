  <h1>Assignment 3: Web Design Readings</h1>

  <h2>1. Do's and Don'ts of Web Design</h2>
  <p>
    From the article, violation of rule #6 (clickable elements are not obvious) can be seen here:  
    <a href="https://www.lingscars.com/" target="_blank">Lingâ€™s Cars Website</a>.  
    The page has mulitple element that are not known to have link and are confused to travel through.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Better User Experience Through Storytelling</h2>
  <p>
    Because stories inherently have a beginning, middle, and end, framing a project in a story format aids in idea refinement.  
    You can more clearly see what is important in your design if you consider the user to be the "main character" and the issue 
    to be the "conflict." This makes you eliminate some extra elements and focus on developing a captivating and significant 
    experience. Also storytelling ensures that every design supports the narrative and helps the audience connect to the project.

  <h2>3. Meet Your Type: Hierarchy in Typography</h2>
  <p>
    Different font sizes, weights (bold vs. light), colors, spacing, and even 
    typefaces can all be used to create hierarchy in typography. 
    These strategies direct the reader's gaze and convey the significance of various textual passages. 
    A good example of strong typographic hierarchy can be found here:  
    <a href="https://www.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple Website</a>.  
    Their design uses clear size differences and whitespace to emphasize the most important information first.
