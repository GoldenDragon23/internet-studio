<h2>Design Choices</h2>
<p>This website’s design feels easygoing and fresh, with a tropical twist that really channels Florida. 
    The colors lots of blue and white bring to mind the ocean and the sky, but they’re not just for show.
    They keep things easy to read and easy on the eyes.
</p>


<p>I went with Arial for the typeface. It’s simple, modern, nothing fussy. 
    The photos pop with bright, sunny energy think beaches, sunlight, 
    that laid-back warmth you get in Florida. Buttons are ocean blue and have soft, 
    rounded edges, which makes them feel friendly and easy to click. Everything’s spaced out nicely, 
    headings sit right in the middle, and you never feel lost on the page.
</p>


<p>Navigation and calls to action sit where you expect them, so you can move around without hassle. 
    The footer’s got all the contact info you need, and every page keeps that same clean look. 
    All together, the design just draws you in, makes you want to explore Florida, and start 
    planning your trip.</p>
